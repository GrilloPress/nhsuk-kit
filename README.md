# Kit

Welcome to Kit.

Kit is an express.js prototyping tool that allows you to create Heroku friendly apps to demo features to users and developers.

## Features

Kit is based on the express.js generator and the structure remains identical apart from a couple of features:

1. Any ```.html``` files in the static directory will be served as is. Be sure to avoid naming your HTML things like ```index.html``` or anything that will interrupt your named routes in ```routes.js```.
2. We use Nunjucks instead of Pug/Jade but we use the ```.html``` file extension. ```.njk``` will not work!.
3. We have a pre-established way of creating new versions within the app by adding ```.html``` files within the ```v1``` directory. All routes will automatically appear to one level (ie no subdirectories just yet!)

If you want to set up another version, you copy the code for setting the v1 route with your new number.

## Adding a new version

Inside your app you need to do three things to set up a new version.

In ```/routes/router.js``` you need to copy the v1 box and replace all references with the version you have created. So, v1 is copied and turned into v2.

In ```/app.js``` you need to copy and create the v1 routes and replace all references with the version you have created.

In ```/views``` you need to create a subdirectory named after the version you have just created.

For example, if you now want to work on v2, you create within your ```/views``` directory a new subdirectory called v2 with a ```index.html``` file inside (a copy of what you find in v1).

## Warning

This is in a state of change.

## How to download and use

Your machine needs to have node.js installed.

It also needs git to be installed (You can get around this by installing the code via https://github.com/GrilloPress/kit/archive/master.zip)

After that, locate where you want it to live on your machine and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/GrilloPress/kit.git name_of_project
cd name_of_project
npm install
npm start
```
